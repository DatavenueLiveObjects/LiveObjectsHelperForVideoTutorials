- Software description: Various resources to help using Orange Live Objects

This repository provides resources, that are presented in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqiOhIRIpjRvR3Bw0hMLciw" target="_blank">Orange Live Objects channel on Youtube</a>, and that will allow one to make use of powerful extended features. The external connector brings cloud-to-cloud and IoT-devices-gateway connectivity in a native way. The custom pipelines and the CellID geolocation add a great way to amend the data while in transit, a just-in-time enrichment of device messages before they are stored or forwarded. While field device management is made easy with remote commands, either one-by-one or with massive amounts of objects.

## External Connector
You want to use some devices, but you cannot adapt their firmware, or their protocol is not natively understood by Live Objects? The external connector is made for you. You will be able to collect data and do device management of those devices through their cloud.

Get in the [corresponding folder](External%20Connector) the resources used in the video https://youtu.be/nvNhTMuTyJU .

## Custom Pipelines
You can enrich you IoT data with external services, decode or transform the messages using an external development.
